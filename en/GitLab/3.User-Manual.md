## Project Management Tips

### Use Templates

- Set default branch protection rules for new projects
- Configure project templates
- Use project inheritance

### Member Management

- Add project members and set access levels
- Use groups to manage multiple projects
- Configure access tokens

### Webhooks

- Configure webhook integrations with external services
- Supported triggers: push, merge request, tag, etc.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Feature Branches**: Develop each feature or fix in a separate branch
2. **Commit Frequently**: Make frequent commits with clear messages
3. **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
4. **Automated Testing**: Ensure CI/CD pipelines include test steps
5. **Maintain Documentation**: Use Wiki for project documentation
6. **Security**: Regularly check security scan reports
