# OpenClaw Installation Guide

OpenClaw supports multiple installation methods, whether you're using macOS, Linux, or Windows. This guide will walk you through each installation option and their prerequisites.

---

## System Requirements

Before installing, make sure your system meets these requirements:

- **Node.js**: 22.0.0 or higher
- **Operating System**:
  - macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or higher
  - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, Fedora 36+, etc.)
  - Windows 10/11 (WSL2 strongly recommended)
- **Network**: Access to npm registry and OpenClaw services
- **Storage**: At least 500MB free space

Check your Node.js version:

```bash
node --version
```

If version is below 22.0.0, please upgrade Node.js first. We recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage multiple Node.js versions.

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Official Installation Script (Recommended)

This is the simplest and fastest way. The official installation script automatically detects your operating system and completes all configuration.

**macOS / Linux:**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash
```

The installation script will:
1. Detect system environment
2. Install or upgrade OpenClaw global package
3. Create necessary configuration directories
4. Set appropriate permissions

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Method 2: npm Global Install

If you already have Node.js and npm installed, you can install directly via npm:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
```

You can also specify a particular version:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@v2026.2.28
```

Available version tags:
- `latest`: Latest stable release
- `beta`: Beta version
- `dev`: Development version

### Method 3: pnpm Install

OpenClaw recommends using pnpm for better dependency management and faster installation:

```bash
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
```

### Method 4: Bun Install

If you use Bun as your JavaScript runtime:

```bash
bun add -g openclaw@latest
```

### Method 5: Build from Source

If you want to use the latest development version or contribute to the project, clone from GitHub and build:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build the project
pnpm ui:build
pnpm build

# Initialize and install service
pnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon

# Development mode (auto-reload)
pnpm gateway:watch
```

**Note**: Running via `pnpm openclaw ...` executes TypeScript directly (via tsx). After building, you can run via `node dist/`.

## Post-Installation Setup

### Onboarding Wizard

After installation, run the onboarding wizard to complete basic setup:

```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

The wizard will guide you through:
1. Configuring API keys (Anthropic recommended)
2. Setting up workspace directory
3. Configuring channel connections (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, etc.)
4. Installing the Gateway background service

### Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual configuration only:

```bash
openclaw configure
```

This starts an interactive configuration wizard.

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check version
openclaw --version

# Check Gateway status
openclaw gateway status

# Open control interface
openclaw dashboard
```

If everything is working, you should see the Gateway running and be able to open the control interface in your browser.

---

## Platform-Specific Notes

### macOS

- Recommended: Use Homebrew to install Node.js: `brew install node`
- After installation, you may need to reload the shell environment
- Recommended: Enable Keychain Access for secure credential storage

### Linux

- Most distributions can install Node.js 22+ via package manager
- Ubuntu/Debian: Use NodeSource repository for latest version
- Ensure build-essential is installed (for compiling native modules)

### Windows

- **WSL2 is strongly recommended** (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- Running directly on Windows may have compatibility issues
- Using WSL2 provides the best experience

## Common Installation Issues

### Issue 1: npm Permission Errors

If you encounter `EACCES` permission errors, don't use sudo to install npm packages. Instead, use nvm to manage Node.js:

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Use nvm to install Node.js
nvm install 22
nvm use 22

# Then install OpenClaw
npm install -g openclaw@latest
```

### Issue 2: Gateway Fails to Start

Check if the port is already in use:

```bash
lsof -i :18789
```

If the port is occupied, either change the port in configuration or stop the process using that port.

### Issue 3: Outdated Version

If the installed version is too old, try updating to the latest version:

```bash
npm update -g openclaw@latest
```

Or reinstall:

```bash
npm uninstall -g openclaw
npm install -g openclaw@latest
```

---

## Docker Installation (Optional)

If you prefer using Docker, OpenClaw also provides official Docker images:

```bash
# Pull image
docker pull openclaw/openclaw:latest

# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name openclaw \
  -p 18789:18789 \
  -v ~/.openclaw:/root/.openclaw \
  openclaw/openclaw:latest
```

Docker is suitable for quick testing, but for full functionality, installing directly on the host is recommended.

---

## Upgrading OpenClaw

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
# Check current version
openclaw --version

# Upgrade
npm update -g openclaw@latest

# Or use official upgrade script
openclaw update
```

After upgrading, run diagnostics:

```bash
openclaw doctor
```

This will check configuration compatibility and potential issues.

---

## Uninstalling OpenClaw

If you need to uninstall OpenClaw:

```bash
# Stop service
openclaw gateway stop

# Uninstall global package
npm uninstall -g openclaw

# Remove configuration directory (optional)
rm -rf ~/.openclaw
```
