# Kubernetes - Introduction

## Overview

Kubernetes (also known as K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. It facilitates both declarative configuration and automation.

## Key Features

- **Automated Rollouts/Rollbacks**: Smoothly roll out or roll back changes
- **Service Discovery & Load Balancing**: Automatically expose containers
- **Storage Orchestration**: Mount local, cloud, or network storage
- **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts failed containers
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Scale applications based on CPU/memory
- **Configuration Management**: Manage secrets and configuration
- **Batch Execution**: Run batch jobs and CI/CD pipelines

## Why Use Kubernetes?

1. **Industry Standard**: Most popular container orchestration
2. **Cloud Native**: Foundation for cloud-native applications
3. **Scalability**: Handle applications of any scale
4. **Portability**: Works on any infrastructure
5. **Ecosystem**: Large ecosystem of tools and plugins
