## Basic Questions

OpenClaw itself is open source and free (MIT license). However, using AI models (like Anthropic Claude or OpenAI GPT) may require payment. You only need to pay for the AI API usage.

### What kind of device do I need to run OpenClaw?

Minimum requirements:
- Node.js 22+
- 2GB RAM
- 500MB disk space

Recommended:
- 4GB+ RAM

  channels: {
    whatsapp: { enabled: true },
    telegram: { enabled: true, botToken: "xxx" },
    discord: { enabled: true, token: "xxx" },
  },
}
```

### Configuration not taking effect?

2. Check if Gateway is running
3. Try restarting the Gateway:
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway restart
   ```

```bash
# Check port usage
lsof -i :18789

# Check configuration
openclaw doctor

# Run as administrator
sudo openclaw gateway
```

### Channel connection failed?

## Usage Questions

### AI won't respond to messages?

Check the following:
1. Is the channel connected?
2. Are you on the whitelist?
3. In groups, is @ mention required?
4. Check error messages in logs

### How to reset a session?

Use `/new` or `/reset` command, or in CLI:
```bash
openclaw session reset
```

### How to change the AI model?

Set in configuration file:

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      model: {
        primary: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## Security Questions

### Is OpenClaw secure?

OpenClaw prioritizes security:
- All data stored locally
- Credentials stored encrypted
- Supports whitelist and pairing mechanisms
- Can enable sandbox isolation

Recommendations:
- Use whitelist to control access
- Update versions regularly
- Run `openclaw doctor` to check security

### How to set up a whitelist?

```json5
{
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123", "+15555550124"],
    },
  },
}
```

### What is Pairing?

Pairing is a security mechanism where unknown users are blocked when they first message. They need your approval before using the AI.

Approve a user:
```bash
openclaw pairing approve --channel whatsapp --sender +15555550123
```
