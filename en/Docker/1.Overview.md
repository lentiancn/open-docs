# Docker Overview

The world's most popular containerization platform.

## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform for developing, deploying, and running applications. Through containerization technology, Docker packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.

### Key Features

- Lightweight - Containers share the kernel, fast startup
- Portable - Build once, run anywhere
- Isolation - Containers are isolated from each other
- Efficient - More resource-efficient than virtual machines

## Core Concepts

- Image - Read-only template used to create containers
- Container - Running instance of an image
- Repository - Place to store images
- Dockerfile - Script that defines how to build an image
