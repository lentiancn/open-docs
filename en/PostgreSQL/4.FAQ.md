## Performance Questions

### How to optimize PostgreSQL queries?

1. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to analyze query execution
2. Create appropriate indexes
3. Use connection pooling (PgBouncer)
4. Optimize `work_mem` and `shared_buffers`
5. Regular `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE`

### When to use indexes?

Create indexes when:
- Column is frequently used in WHERE clauses
- Column is used in JOIN operations
- Column has high cardinality (many unique values)

Avoid indexes when:
- Table is small
- Column is frequently updated
- Column has low cardinality

### What is VACUUM?

VACUUM reclaims storage occupied by deleted or updated rows. Run regularly:

```sql
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```
