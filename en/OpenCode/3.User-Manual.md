# OpenCode User Manual

Basic usage and techniques for OpenCode.

## Quick Start

### Ask Questions

You can ask OpenCode to explain the codebase:

```
How is authentication handled in @packages/functions/src/api/index.ts
```

### Add Features

Before adding features, it's recommended to have OpenCode create a plan first:

1. Press **Tab** to switch to Plan mode
2. Describe the feature you want
3. After seeing the plan, provide feedback or add more details
4. When satisfied, press **Tab** to switch back to Build mode

### Make Direct Changes

For more straightforward changes, you can ask OpenCode directly:

```
We need to add authentication to the /settings route. Take a look at how this is handled in the /notes route and implement the same logic.
```

### Undo Changes

If you're not satisfied with changes, use the undo command:

```bash
/undo
```

OpenCode will revert the changes and show your original message again. You can tweak your prompt and ask again.

### Redo

You can use `/redo` to redo changes.

## Share Sessions

```bash
/share
```

This creates a link to the current session and copies it to your clipboard.
