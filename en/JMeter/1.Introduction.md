# Apache JMeter

## Overview

Apache JMeter™ is open source software, a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions.

## What can JMeter do?

Apache JMeter can be used to test performance both on static and dynamic resources, Web dynamic applications. It can simulate a heavy load on a server, group of servers, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load types.

### Key Features

- **Multi-protocol Support**: Web (HTTP, HTTPS), SOAP/REST Webservices, FTP, Database via JDBC, LDAP, JMS, Mail, TCP, Java Objects
- **Full-featured Test IDE**: Record test plans from browsers or native applications
- **CLI Mode**: Load test from any Java compatible OS
- **Dynamic HTML Reports**: Complete and ready to present
- **Data Extraction**: Support for HTML, JSON, XML, and regular expressions
- **100% Java**: Complete portability
- **Multi-threading**: Concurrent sampling by many threads
- **Highly Extensible**: Pluggable samplers and scriptable samplers (Groovy, BeanShell)
- **CI Integration**: Maven, Gradle, and Jenkins support

## What JMeter is NOT

JMeter is not a browser - it works at protocol level. It does not execute JavaScript found in HTML pages or render HTML pages as a browser does.

## Getting Started

1. Download JMeter from the official website
2. Run the JMeter script (jmeter.bat for Windows, jmeter.sh for Linux/Mac)
3. Create your test plan using the GUI
4. Run tests and analyze results
