# Yarn 🧶

## What is Yarn?

Yarn is a powerful **package manager** and project manager. Whether you work on simple projects or large monorepos, whether you're an open source developer or an enterprise user, Yarn has your back.

Yarn is a dependency management tool designed specifically for JavaScript projects. It helps you install, update, configure, and remove package dependencies more efficiently. Yarn focuses on **speed**, **correctness**, **security**, and **developer experience**, continuously improving across all dimensions through innovative features like workspaces, offline caching, parallel installs, hardened mode, interactive commands, and more.

### Yarn's Core Features

- **Workspaces**: The first package manager built specifically around workspaces, letting you split your project into sub-components
- **Stability**: Yarn guarantees that installs that work today will keep working the same way in the future
- **Well-documented**: Great care is put into documentation, which keeps improving with each new version
- **Plugin System**: Yarn may not solve all your problems - but it'll give you the tools to solve the ones you find
- **Innovation**: Yarn will always be at the frontline, challenging the status quo
- **Fully Independent**: Yarn is a completely independent open-source project tied to no company

### Use Cases

- Simple projects
- Large monorepo management
- Enterprise applications
- Open source project maintenance
- Cross-team collaboration projects

## Workspaces

Workspaces are one of Yarn's most powerful features, allowing you to manage multiple packages in a single repository.

### Configuring Workspaces

Add workspaces to root package.json:

```json
{
  "workspaces": [
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

### Workspace Commands

```bash
# Add to specific workspace
yarn workspace @my-org/core add lodash

# Run command in workspace
yarn workspace @my-org/core run build

# Run in all workspaces
yarn workspaces foreach -pt run build
```

## Configuration

### .yarnrc.yml

Yarn 4+ uses .yarnrc.yml for configuration:

```yaml
npmRegistryServer: "https://registry.npmjs.org"
nodeLinker: node-modules
enableGlobalCache: false
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always commit yarn.lock** - Ensures consistent installs across all environments
2. **Use --immutable in CI** - Prevents accidental lockfile modifications
3. **Update dependencies regularly** - Get latest features and security fixes
4. **Use workspaces** - Simplifies multi-package project management
5. **Clean cache periodically** - Use `yarn cache clean`
