# PyTorch FAQ

## General Questions

### What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Meta. It provides a flexible platform for deep learning with dynamic computation graphs.

### PyTorch vs TensorFlow - which is better?

Both are excellent frameworks. PyTorch is more Pythonic and has dynamic graphs (easier for research). TensorFlow has better production deployment options (TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow Lite).

### Is PyTorch free?

Yes, PyTorch is open-source and free under the BSD license.

## Installation Questions

### How to install PyTorch with CUDA?

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

### "No module named 'torch'" error?

- Install PyTorch: `pip install torch`
- Check if using correct Python environment

### CUDA not available?

- Check NVIDIA GPU: `nvidia-smi`
- Verify PyTorch CUDA version matches your CUDA installation
- Reinstall PyTorch with correct CUDA index

## Usage Questions

### How to train a model?

1. Define model class
2. Create data loaders
3. Define loss function and optimizer
4. Training loop with forward/backward pass

### How to use GPU?

```python
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = model.to(device)
data = data.to(device)
```

### How to save/load models?

```python
# Save
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')

# Load
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
```

### How to use pretrained models?

```python
import torchvision.models as models
resnet = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
```

## Performance Questions

### Training is too slow?

- Use GPU if available
- Increase batch size (within memory limits)
- Use mixed precision (FP16)
- Use DataLoader with multiple workers
- Enable cuDNN benchmark mode

### Out of memory errors?

- Reduce batch size
- Use gradient accumulation
- Reduce image size
- Clear cache: `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`

## Common Errors

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| CUDA out of memory | Reduce batch size |
| RuntimeError: expected scalar type | Check tensor dtypes |
| AttributeError: module 'torch' has no attribute | Check PyTorch version |
