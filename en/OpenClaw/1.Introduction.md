# OpenClaw 🦞

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw is a **self-hosted gateway** that connects your favorite chat apps — WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and more — to AI coding agents like Pi. You run a single Gateway process on your own machine (or a server), and it becomes the bridge between your messaging apps and an always-available AI assistant.

### Core Features

- **Self-hosted**: Runs on your hardware, your rules
- **Multi-channel**: One Gateway serves WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and more simultaneously
- **Agent-native**: Built for coding agents with tool use, sessions, memory, and multi-agent routing
- **Open source**: MIT licensed, community-driven

### Who is it for?

Developers and power users who want a personal AI assistant they can message from anywhere — without giving up control of their data or relying on a hosted service.

### System Requirements

- Node.js 22 or higher
- An API key (Anthropic recommended)
- 5 minutes of your time

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-channel Gateway
A single Gateway process supports WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, iMessage, and other major chat platforms. You can also add more channels through extension plugins like Mattermost.

### Multi-agent Routing
Run isolated agents for different channels, accounts, or users, each with its own workspace and sessions.

### Media Support
Send and receive images, audio, and documents. Media files can be transcribed and processed.

### Web Control UI
Chat, configure settings, manage sessions, and control nodes through a browser-based dashboard.

### Mobile Nodes
Pair iOS and Android devices as nodes to enable camera capture, screen recording, location access, and more.

### Voice Mode
Enable voice interaction anywhere through Voice Wake and Talk Mode, supporting macOS, iOS, and Android.

### Automation
Schedule tasks with Cron Jobs, set up Webhooks, and integrate with Gmail Pub/Sub for complex workflow automation.

## How It Works

```
Chat Apps → Gateway → AI Agent

        CLI / Web UI / macOS App / Mobile Nodes
```

The Gateway serves as the single source of truth for sessions, routing, and channel connections.

## Channel Configuration

### WhatsApp

```bash
openclaw channels login
openclaw gateway --port 18789
```

Control who can message the assistant using `channels.whatsapp.allowFrom` to set a whitelist.

### Telegram

Add to your configuration file:
```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "yourBotToken",
    },
  },
}
```

### Discord

```json5
{
  channels: {
    discord: {
      token: "yourBotToken",
    },
  },
}
```

---

## Configuration

OpenClaw uses a JSON5 configuration file at `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

### Minimal Configuration Example

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace",
    },
  },
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      allowFrom: ["+15555550123"],
    },
  },
}
```

### Common Configuration Options

- **agents.defaults.model**: Set primary and fallback models
- **channels**: Configure each channel's connection and policies
- **session**: Control session scope and reset policies
- **cron**: Configure scheduled tasks
- **hooks**: Configure webhook endpoints
- **browser**: Configure browser control

Configuration supports hot reload — changes apply without manual restart.

## Security Recommendations

- Treat incoming DMs as untrusted input
- Use pairing (pairing) strategy — unknown senders need approval before using the assistant
- For groups, enable mention mode (requireMention) recommended
- Use sandbox mode to isolate non-main sessions
- Run `openclaw doctor` regularly to check for configuration risks
