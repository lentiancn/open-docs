# JUnit 5 - Introduction

## Overview

JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit, a programmer-friendly testing framework for Java and the JVM. It aims to provide a robust testing foundation for writing tests in Java.

## What is JUnit?

JUnit is an open source framework for writing and running unit tests. It is part of the xUnit family of testing frameworks and is the de facto standard for testing Java applications.

## Key Features of JUnit 5

### Modular Architecture
JUnit 5 is composed of three distinct modules:
- **JUnit Platform**: Foundation for launching testing frameworks on the JVM
- **JUnit Jupiter**: New programming model for writing tests (JUnit 5)
- **JUnit Vintage**: Engine for running JUnit 3 and 4 tests on the platform

### Modern Features
- **Descriptive Test Names**: Support for display names with spaces and special characters
- **Nested Tests**: Support for nested inner test classes
- **Parameterized Tests**: Built-in support for parameterized tests
- **Repeated Tests**: Run tests multiple times
- **Dynamic Tests**: Tests generated at runtime
- **Tagging and Filtering**: Organize tests with tags

### Extension Model
- Replaces the old Runner model with a more flexible Extension API
- Dependency Injection for test constructors and methods
- Conditional test execution

### Improved Assertions
- Grouped assertions for better error reporting
- Exception assertions with lambdas
- Timeout assertions
- Support for custom assertion messages

## Why Upgrade to JUnit 5?

1. **Modern Java Features**: Takes advantage of Java 8+ features like lambdas and streams
2. **Better Test Organization**: Nested classes and tagging improve test structure
3. **Flexible Extensions**: More powerful extension model than JUnit 4
4. **Parallel Execution**: Better support for running tests in parallel
5. **Clearer Errors**: Improved assertion messages make debugging easier

## Getting Started

To start using JUnit 5, you need to add the JUnit Jupiter dependency to your project. It can be used with Maven, Gradle, or any build tool.
