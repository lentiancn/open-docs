# JMeter FAQ

## General Questions

### What is Apache JMeter?
Apache JMeter is an open source software designed for load testing and performance measurement. It's a 100% pure Java application that can test functional behavior and measure performance.

### What protocols does JMeter support?
JMeter supports multiple protocols including:
- HTTP/HTTPS
- SOAP/REST Web Services
- FTP
- JDBC (Database)
- LDAP
- JMS (Message-oriented middleware)
- SMTP/POP3/IMAP (Mail)
- TCP
- Java Objects

### Is JMeter a browser?
No, JMeter is not a browser. It works at the protocol level and does not execute JavaScript or render HTML pages like a real browser.

## Installation Questions

### What are the system requirements?
- Java 8 or higher
- At least 4GB RAM recommended
- Compatible OS: Windows, Linux, macOS

### How do I install JMeter?
1. Download from https://jmeter.apache.org/
2. Extract the archive
3. Run jmeter.sh (Linux/Mac) or jmeter.bat (Windows)

### Why is JMeter not starting?
- Check Java is installed: `java -version`
- Verify JAVA_HOME is set
- Check for port conflicts

### How do I increase memory for JMeter?
Edit the jmeter startup script and modify the HEAP variable:
```bash
HEAP="-Xms1g -Xmx4g"
```

## Usage Questions

### How do I create a basic test plan?
1. Add a Thread Group
2. Add HTTP Request Sampler
3. Add Listeners (View Results Tree, Summary Report)
4. Run the test

### What is a Thread Group?
Thread Group defines a group of virtual users that will execute the same test. It controls:
- Number of threads (users)
- Ramp-up period
- Loop count

### How do I extract data from responses?
Use extractors:
- JSON Extractor for JSON responses
- XPath Extractor for XML/HTML
- Regular Expression Extractor for any text

### How do I parameterize tests?
Use variables and functions:
- `${variable}` for variable references
- `${__Random(1,100)}` for random values
- `${__time()}`

### Can JMeter handle authentication?
Yes, JMeter supports:
- Basic Authentication
- NTLM Authentication
- Cookie Manager
- Authorization Manager

## Performance Questions

### How many users can JMeter simulate?
The number depends on your hardware. With proper tuning:
- GUI mode: 100-300 users
- CLI mode: 1000+ users
- Distributed testing: 10,000+ users

### What is distributed testing?
Distributed testing uses multiple machines to generate more load. One master coordinates multiple slave machines.

### How do I run JMeter in headless mode?
```bash
jmeter -n -t testplan.jmx -l results.jtl
```

## Troubleshooting

### OutOfMemoryError during test
- Increase heap size
- Reduce number of threads
- Use CLI mode instead of GUI
- Disable unnecessary listeners

### Results not showing
- Check if test is actually running
- Verify listener is attached to correct element
- Check log files for errors

### High response times
- Check your network
- Verify server performance
- Reduce load if server is overwhelmed

### How to debug my test plan?
1. Use View Results Tree listener
2. Enable debug logging
3. Start with single thread
4. Check assertions

## Best Practices

1. Always use CLI mode for load tests
2. Start with low load and gradually increase
3. Use assertions to validate responses
4. Clean up after tests (tearDown)
5. Keep test plans version controlled
6. Monitor system resources
