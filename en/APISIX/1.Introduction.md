# Apache APISIX Introduction

## What is Apache APISIX

Apache APISIX is a **cloud-native API gateway** and **AI gateway**, developed by API7.ai and donated to the Apache Software Foundation. It has become a top-level project at the Apache Software Foundation.

You can think of APISIX as a "traffic manager" sitting between clients and backend services. It receives all requests from clients and decides how to handle them based on predefined rules—whether to forward them directly to a backend service, perform load balancing, or authenticate before forwarding.

## Core Purpose

- **Traditional API Gateway**: Manage north-south traffic (from external to internal networks)
- **Service Mesh**: Handle east-west traffic (between services)
- **Kubernetes Ingress Controller**: Act as the entry point for Kubernetes clusters
- **AI Gateway**: Support LLM proxying, load balancing, retry fallbacks, token rate limiting for AI scenarios

## Key Features

### 1. Full Dynamic Capabilities

APISIX's biggest feature is **dynamic configuration updates without restart**. You can add, modify, or delete routes, upstreams, plugins, and other configurations at any time. Changes take effect immediately without affecting in-flight requests.

- **Dynamic Routing**: Flexible matching based on request parameters, headers, cookies
- **Dynamic Upstreams**: Switch backend service nodes without restart
- **Dynamic Certificates**: Support hot-reloading of HTTPS certificates
- **Hot-pluggable Plugins**: Enable or disable plugins without restarting the gateway

### 2. Rich Traffic Management

- **Load Balancing**: Support round-robin, weighted, consistent hashing, and more
- **Canary Release**: Smoothly migrate traffic from old to new versions
- **A/B Testing**: Assign users to different service versions based on conditions
- **Traffic Split**: Precisely control traffic distribution between services
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatically detect and isolate faulty upstream services

### 3. Comprehensive Security

APISIX provides multiple authentication and access control plugins:

- Key Authentication
- JWT Authentication
- Basic Authentication
- OAuth 2.0
- HMAC Authentication
- LDAP Authentication
- IP Whitelist/Blacklist
- Referer Anti-theft
- CSRF Protection
- Rate Limiting (limit-count, limit-req, limit-concurrency)

### 4. Observability

APISIX has built-in complete monitoring and tracing capabilities:

- **Prometheus Metrics**: Real-time gateway performance monitoring
- **Distributed Tracing**: Support Zipkin and SkyWalking
- **Log Management**: Send access logs to Kafka, Elasticsearch, Splunk, etc.
- **Monitoring Alerts**: Support multiple alert notifications

### 5. Multi-Protocol Support

APISIX supports not only traditional HTTP/HTTPS but also:

- TCP/UDP Proxy
- gRPC and gRPC Web
- Dubbo
- MQTT
- WebSocket
- HTTP/3 (QUIC)

### 6. Multi-Language Plugin Development

APISIX supports writing custom plugins in multiple languages:

- Lua (native support)
- Java (via Java Plugin Runner)
- Go (via Go Plugin Runner)
- Python (via Python Plugin Runner)
- Wasm (WebAssembly)

## Technical Architecture

APISIX has a clean and simple architecture:

- **Data Plane**: Uses Nginx + Lua for high-performance request processing
- **Control Plane**: Uses etcd for configuration storage and cluster synchronization
- **Management Plane**: Provides REST Admin API and Dashboard UI for configuration

APISIX nodes are stateless, enabling easy horizontal scaling. High availability is achieved by configuring multiple etcd addresses.

## Use Cases

- Build API gateway for microservice architectures
- Ingress gateway for Kubernetes clusters
- Protect internal API services with authentication and access control
- Implement rate limiting and circuit breaking for API protection
- Expose traditional services as APIs for external consumption
- Act as a gateway for AI applications, managing LLM requests
- Implement blue-green deployment and canary releases

## Summary

Apache APISIX is a powerful, high-performance, and extensible cloud-native API gateway. It combines dynamic, real-time, and high-performance characteristics to help you easily manage API traffic and implement enterprise-level features like authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring. Whether you're a small startup or a large enterprise, APISIX can meet your API gateway needs.
