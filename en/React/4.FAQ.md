# React FAQ

## General Questions

### What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Meta. It uses a component-based approach and virtual DOM for efficient UI updates.

### React vs Angular - which is better?

React is a library (flexible, just the view layer), while Angular is a full framework. React is easier to learn and has a larger ecosystem. Angular provides more built-in features.

### Is React free?

Yes, React is open-source and free to use under the MIT license.

## Usage Questions

### What is JSX?

JSX is a syntax extension that lets you write HTML-like code in JavaScript. It gets transformed to JavaScript function calls.

### What is the virtual DOM?

The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses it to efficiently update only the parts of the real DOM that have changed.

### What are hooks?

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks:
- `useState` - Manage component state
- `useEffect` - Handle side effects
- `useContext` - Access context
- `useRef` - Reference DOM elements

### How to pass data between components?

- **Props**: Pass data from parent to child
- **Context**: Share data across components
- **State Management**: Use Redux, Zustand, or Jotai

### How to handle forms in React?

```jsx
function Form() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('');

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log(value);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input value={value} onChange={e => setValue(e.target.value)} />
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Performance Questions

### Why is my React app slow?

- Too many re-renders
- Not using proper key props in lists
- Heavy computations in render
- Missing optimization (useMemo, useCallback)

### How to optimize React performance?

- Use `React.memo` for component memoization
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for expensive operations
- Implement code splitting with `React.lazy`
- Use production build for deployment
