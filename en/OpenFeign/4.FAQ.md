# OpenFeign FAQ

## General Questions

### What is OpenFeign?

OpenFeign is a Java library that provides declarative REST client capabilities. It allows developers to define HTTP service interfaces using annotations, making it easier to consume REST APIs.

### What is the difference between Feign and OpenFeign?

Feign was originally created by Netflix. OpenFeign is the open-source version maintained by the community after Netflix stopped active development on Feign.

### Is OpenFeign only for Spring applications?

No, OpenFeign can be used in any Java application. The Spring Cloud OpenFeign integration is optional and only needed for Spring Boot applications.

## Installation & Setup

### Which version should I use?

For new projects, use the latest stable version (13.x). For Spring Cloud integration, ensure version compatibility with your Spring Boot version.

### Do I need additional dependencies?

The core Feign library is sufficient for basic usage. Additional dependencies like `feign-okhttp` or `feign-jackson` are optional but recommended for better performance and JSON handling.

### How do I enable OpenFeign in Spring Boot?

Add the `@EnableFeignClients` annotation to your main application class:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableFeignClients
public class MyApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MyApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

## Usage Questions

### How do I handle authentication?

Use a `RequestInterceptor` to add authentication headers:

```java
@Component
public class AuthInterceptor implements RequestInterceptor {
    @Override
    public void apply(RequestTemplate template) {
        template.header("Authorization", "Bearer " + getToken());
    }
}
```

### How do I handle errors?

Implement `ErrorDecoder` to customize error handling:

```java
@Component
public class CustomErrorDecoder implements ErrorDecoder {
    @Override
    public Exception decode(String methodKey, Response response) {
        // Custom error handling logic
        return new RuntimeException("Error: " + response.status());
    }
}
```

### How do I use fallback?

Define a fallback class that implements your Feign client interface:

```java
@FeignClient(name = "service", fallback = ServiceFallback.class)
public interface ServiceClient {
    // methods
}

@Component
public class ServiceFallback implements ServiceClient {
    // implement all methods with fallback logic
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection timeout errors?

Increase timeout values in your configuration:

```yaml
feign:
  client:
    config:
      default:
        connectTimeout: 10000
        readTimeout: 10000
```

### NullPointerException in Fallback?

Ensure your fallback class is a Spring component and properly handles null cases.

### How to debug HTTP requests?

Enable logging in your configuration:

```yaml
feign:
  client:
    config:
      default:
        loggerLevel: full
```

Set logging level to DEBUG in `logback.xml`:

```xml
<logger name="feign" level="DEBUG"/>
```
