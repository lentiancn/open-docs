# Kotlin - Introduction

## Overview

Kotlin is a modern, statically typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be compiled to JavaScript or native code.

## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. It is designed to interoperate fully with Java and is officially supported by Google for Android development.

## Key Features

- **Concise**: Reduces boilerplate code significantly
- **Safe**: Built-in null safety to prevent NullPointerExceptions
- **Interoperable**: 100% compatible with Java
- **Tool-friendly**: Excellent IDE support
- **Coroutines**: Built-in support for asynchronous programming
- **Multi-platform**: Targets JVM, JavaScript, and Native

## Why Use Kotlin?

1. **Modern Language**: Modern features not available in Java
2. **Android Official**: Preferred language for Android development
3. **Less Code**: Significantly less boilerplate than Java
4. **Safe**: Null safety built into the type system
5. **Great Community**: Strong support and growing ecosystem
