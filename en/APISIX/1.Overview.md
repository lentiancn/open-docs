# APISIX Overview

Cloud-Native API Gateway.

## What is APISIX?

APISIX is a cloud-native API gateway developed by the Apache Software Foundation, providing high-performance and high-availability API management services. As a dynamic, real-time, and scalable API gateway, APISIX has become the preferred solution for millions of containerized deployments.

### Core Features

- **High Performance**: Built on Nginx + Lua, single core can handle 10k+ QPS
- **Dynamic Routing**: Dynamically update routing rules without restart
- **Plugin System**: Rich plugin ecosystem with hot-loading support
- **Service Discovery**: Support for Consul, Eureka, Nacos and other mechanisms
- **Load Balancing**: Multiple strategies including roundrobin, hashing, consistent hashing
- **Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, JWT, firewall
- **Visual Dashboard**: Intuitive management interface
- **Multi-Protocol Support**: HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP/2, Dubbo, gRPC, WebSocket

### Technical Architecture

APISIX uses Nginx as the underlying HTTP reverse proxy server, combined with Lua scripts for dynamic orchestration. The architecture is divided into:
