# Redis Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Redis?
Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data types including strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets.

### Is Redis free to use?
Yes, Redis is open-source and free to use. It is released under the BSD 3-Clause license.

### What programming languages can I use with Redis?
Redis provides client libraries for almost every major programming language, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, and many more.

## Installation Questions

### How do I install Redis on Windows?
Redis is primarily designed for Unix-like systems. However, you can use:
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- Memurai (Redis-compatible alternative)
- Docker containers

### How do I install Redis on Linux/macOS?
You can install Redis using package managers:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install redis-server

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install redis

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install redis
```

### How do I start the Redis server?
After installation, start Redis with:
```bash
redis-server
```

To connect to Redis, use:
```bash
redis-cli
```

## Usage Questions

### How do I store and retrieve data in Redis?
```python
import redis

r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Store a value
r.set('mykey', 'Hello Redis!')

# Retrieve a value
value = r.get('mykey')
print(value)  # b'Hello Redis!'
```

### What is the difference between Redis and Memcached?
| Feature | Redis | Memcached |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Data Types | Multiple | String only |
| Persistence | Yes | No |
| Replication | Yes | Limited |
| Clustering | Yes | No |
| Lua Scripting | Yes | No |

### How do Redis transactions work?
Redis transactions allow you to group multiple commands together:
```python
pipe = r.pipeline()
pipe.set('key1', 'value1')
pipe.set('key2', 'value2')
pipe.execute()
```

## Performance Questions

### How fast is Redis?
Redis can perform millions of operations per second with sub-millisecond latency.

### How much data can Redis store?
Redis can store hundreds of millions of keys. The main limitation is available RAM.

### Does Redis support clustering?
Yes, Redis Cluster provides automatic data partitioning across multiple nodes with high availability.

## Troubleshooting

### Why is Redis consuming too much memory?
- Check for large keys or values
- Review memory usage with `INFO memory`
- Use appropriate data structures
- Enable eviction policies

### How do I persist data in Redis?
Configure persistence in `redis.conf`:
- RDB: Periodic snapshots
- AOF: Append-only file logging
- Both combined

### How do I secure Redis?
- Bind to localhost only
- Use password authentication
- Enable TLS encryption
- Set appropriate file permissions

## Advanced Questions

### What is Redis Sentinel?
Redis Sentinel provides high availability by monitoring master/slave deployments and automatically performing failover.

### Can Redis be used as a message queue?
Yes, Redis supports pub/sub messaging and can be used as a lightweight message queue with List operations.

### What is Lua scripting in Redis?
Lua scripts allow you to execute multiple commands atomically on the server side, improving performance and enabling complex operations.
